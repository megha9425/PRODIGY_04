Basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes

This Python keylogger records keystrokes and saves them to a file (keylog.txt). It uses the pynput library to capture keyboard inputs, logging both regular characters and special keys (like Enter, Shift, etc.). The script runs in the background and continuously logs keystrokes until manually stopped.
